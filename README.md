# MindTrack

### Mental Health Tracking. 

Functionally acts as a Diary with some useful visualization.

Originally inspired by my Fitbit App, I wanted to be able to not only log the mood I was in, but I wanted to be able to keep a log of what I was feeling.

Created entirely in Next.js using NextUI's component library.
Updated to NextUI 2.0


### Data Storage

All storage is handled by Firebase (Firestore). Entries are in plain text, so while other users won't see your data, the admin (me) can.
Adapting this to being market-ready would require setting up a backend to handle data encryption and decryption which is well outside the scope of my project (for no other reason than hosting).

### OAuth

Using the Application as is requires a google account to sign in with. Effectively needs a login to access the app.


# cloning

To clone this project you will need to set up your own Firebase project to get a configuration file from Firebase.
Create the file, `.env.local` in the root folder of the project, then set the key value pairs that coincide with the ones in /src/config/Firebase.js

### Known Bugs

Table will auto sort on deleting an entry. Only way I know how to fix it is with using a state manager which is too high a time investment for such a small bug.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
